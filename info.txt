Creating pipeline in aws,

Automating  whenever I push code to main branch of this repo, build and deployment in aws automatically.
Docker build, tag and pushing is also automaized in build.

Create AWS Code Pipeline,
    Link to Code commit to github repo
    Use AWS CodeBuilder
    Need appropriate policy for IAM the one via which pipeline has been getting generated.

Need EKSCTL installation.
Also created cluser.yaml file, to create EKS cluster.
